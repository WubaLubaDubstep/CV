        <h2>Who am I?</h2>
        <p>I have a passion for all aspects of technology and am actively seeking to build a career in this environment. As a person who is a critical thinker, thoughtful, innovative and a problem solver I have discovered that being in the field of Software Engineering brings many personal rewards in my life. 
        </p>

        <p>Coupled with my appetite for technology, statistics and numbers I am deeply passionate about music and have graduated from the Associated Board of London Royal School of Music Grade 8 Classical Performance.
            As a student I have been extensively involved in my community, which has allowed me to develop strong interpersonal skills. My involvement in various events, including Music Director in various stage musical productions eisteddfods and fund-raising charity events, have allowed me to develop strong time management and organisational skills, which I see as being very important. 
        </p>

        <p>I believe that I have a lot to offer your organisation. I am keen to develop my professional skills and look forward to discussing my application with you at an interview. I have enclosed a copy of my curriculum vitae for your consideration. I can be contacted at all times on the details provided above.
